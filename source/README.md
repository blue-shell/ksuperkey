KSUPERKEY
=========

ksuperkey allows you to open the application launcher in KDE Plasma Desktop
using the Super key (also known as the "Windows key"). If you hold down the
Super key it will still act as a modifier key, allowing you to use it for
other keyboard shortcuts.

ksuperkey is a small application that runs in the background as a daemon. It
was forked from xcape by Albin Olsson: https://github.com/alols/xcape
